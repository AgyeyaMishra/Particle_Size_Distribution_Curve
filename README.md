# Particle Size Distribution Curve

This is a really small personal project done for **Department of Civil Engineering, Delhi Technological University (formerly Delhi College of Engineering)** for a course in **Soil Mechanics (Course Code - CE206)**.

It is a simple program using ```Python```, ```Pandas``` and ```Matplotlib```that helps a user to plot a particle size distribution curve for a soil sample.
