# Particle Size Distribution Curve

This is a really small personal project done for **Department of Civil Engineering, Delhi Technological University (formerly Delhi College of Engineering)** for a course in **Soil Mechanics (Course Code - CE206)**.

It is a simple program using ```Python```, ```Pandas``` and ```Matplotlib```that helps a user to plot a particle size distribution curve for a soil sample.

### What is a Particle Size Distribution Curve?

A particle size distribution curve or grain size distribution curve represents the size range of soil grains in a given soil mass as percentages of the total dry weight. Engineers or lab technicians perform a sieve analysis for coarse-grain soils such as gravels and sands and hydrometer analysis for fine-grained soils like silts and clays to determine the soil sampleâ€™s grain size distribution. The results of mechanical analysis (sieve and hydrometer analyses) are generally presented by these semi-logarithmic plots known as particle-size distribution curves. The particle diameters are plotted in log scale, and the corresponding percent finer in arithmetic scale.
